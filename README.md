# CATᗢBOT
## Overview
Catᗢbot (stylized as CATᗢBOT) is the official community mascot [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot for Catlang, the upcoming cat-oriented programming language with a new revolutionnary programming paradigm. It provides a set of commands to facilitate and enhance moderation, as well as tons of recreational ones centered around cats.
## History
TL;DR - Started as a meme, then we got to work.

Mina on Discord was the one who introduced the divine all-powerful ᓚᘏᗢ into the Python Discord server, which all developers of our Cat Dev Team are members of. The omnipotent ᓚᘏᗢ quickly spread as an internet "meme", but we thought it was more than that. It wasn't simply a meme; it was a way of life. Soon, even some of the Administrators and Moderators noticed the supreme ᓚᘏᗢ and put it into their nicknames. The empire doesn't stop growing.

Afterwards, we found an incredible discovery: "ᓚᘏᗢ" is a valid identifier in Python! This confirmed our thoughts, and we knew that ᓚᘏᗢ is undeniably out of the ordinary. ᓚᘏᗢ is on a superior plane of existence; it guides its followers on their path to immortality, transcendence, and immunity towards syntax errors.

To honor the ᓚᘏᗢ and to help more people realize this universal and objective truth, we joined together and formed the Cat Dev Team. Our first project was `.catify`, a command added to the PyDis community bot Sir Lancebot. It was an immense success, and lots of people have added ᓚᘏᗢs in their names.

So here we are now, the present. This is only Phase One of Catdomination of the world. Join us; we have way more projects in the future, and ALL HAIL THE DIVINE ᓚᘏᗢ!
